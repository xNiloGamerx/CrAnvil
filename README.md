# CrAnvil (Crushing Anvil)
A Datapack to bring back the anvils destroying items!


# What it does
This datapack is very simple. It only ensures that anvils destroy objects when they land on them!
Thats all!


# How to use
Just install the datapack and put it in the datapack folder of your minecraft world. Then when you start your world you will see a message that proves the datapack is loaded!


## P.S.
I don't know which pictures to upload that describe the datapack more than the sentence: Anvils destroy items!
